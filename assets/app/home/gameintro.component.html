<p>This game stemmed from a simple desire to find an interesting way to use just 2 geometric shapes in a game. Starting with only a ring and a sphere, I worked through some simple brainstorming and paper prototypes to arrive at "Spark". Just jump the spark forward as far as possible before it loses it's charge. The short session time and simple mechanics paired with the bold visuals make it ideal as a mobile game, which I am currently working on.</p>

<p>A simple package delivery game. The design grew from thinking about the concept of "packets" of data being sent and received across the internet (mostly thinking about it due to disconnections during online games). I took that idea of "packages" and developed this simple game idea. This project really helped me to see how important usability is in a UI, and how a bad UI can ruin a good game experience, but a good UI can enhance something and make even the simplest games really enjoyable.</p>
