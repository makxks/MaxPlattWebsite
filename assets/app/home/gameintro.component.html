  <p>This is a selection of my games, the game pages hold more information about design and design decisions, and also contain links to download and play all the games along with links to the git repos (if available).</p>
  <p>These games are so far all built using Unity and C#. Although in the case of Unity and the way I use it C# is used more like a scripting language than a full programming language, I feel it has given me a good familiarity with the language and also with some problems that I would not otherwise have come across if I was only working on web applications. Solving problems such as A* pathfinding and procedural generation, while relatively basic, have let me experience and solve in my own way some more interesting problems. This side of things has also allowed me to learn more about design, specifically game design and the processes there in, but many can be applied to other areas of design and beyond. While this has given me some beneficial experience the main thing is that I find designing and making games fun, so I keep doing it!</p>
