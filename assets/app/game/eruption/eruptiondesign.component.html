    <p>The design of eruption is focussed on making a short, interesting, puzzle game with as much replayability as possible. Several decisions were made to make sure that (especially in speed mode) the game is simple enough to be played very fast, but with enough difficulty to make it interesting</p>

    <p>The tiling was first prototyped using squares but hexagonal squares provide a much better, and clearer lava movement dynamic. The hexagonal interlocking pattern can clearly show that the lava has a chance to move left or right when it moves to the next row. This also cleared up the movement design of the lava, as the options for movement were reduced to left, right, or split. The cylinder of hexagons is procedurally generated as the player progresses, with each tile having a specific chance of being set as rock, water, or city. Rocks are very important as they provide obstacles, and without these obstacles the game becomes too simple, with there even being a possibility of redirecting all the lava to a single stream and endlessly continuing the game, so by adding rock tiles where the player cannot build some more thought has to be used to place the trenches. In a similar way to the rocks providing extra obstacles, the water provides targets. When the lava hits a water tile it is slowed down, so that it's movement takes twice as long through that tile, giving the player longer to decide on their next move.</p>
